# AssetWatcher
Cryptocurrency price watcher


# Motivation
I wrote this program as a proof of concept. The idea is to make a chat bot that will alert me when my assets are low or high. I will add commands that will allow me to change the watch list and thresholds without touching the code. The bot will run 24/7 and use a database to backup the data, in case of downtime.


# How to use?
Use a notepad or IDE to:
- Adjust coin and threshold parameters in the first two lists.
- Run the script.
